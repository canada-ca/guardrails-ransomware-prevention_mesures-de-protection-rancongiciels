# Apply Protection Measures on Endpoint Devices

([Back](#guidelines))

## Objective

Prevent malware from running on devices by keeping them well- configured, patched and up to date.

## Description

- Centrally manage devices in order to only permit applications trusted by the enterprise to run on devices.
- Use antivirus or anti-malware tools set to automatically scan emails and flash drives, and keep the software (and its definition files) up to date.
- Configure host-based and network firewalls, disallowing inbound connections by default.
- Implement cyber defense tools and technology (e.g., CCCS host-based sensors)
- Use the latest versions of Operating Systems and applications to take advantage of the latest security features.
- Disable macros to decrease the risk of ransomware being spread through Microsoft Office attachments.
- Scan hardware, software, and operating system for vulnerabilities and apply patches and updates to mitigate the risk of the vulnerabilities being exploited by a threat actor, in alignment with GC [Patch Management Guidance.](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/online-security-privacy/patch-management-guidance.html)
