# Continuously Monitor Networks and Systems

([Back](/README.md#guidelines))

## Objective

Establish a baseline for acceptable activity patterns within the organization to detect attacks and indicators of potential attacks.

## Description

- Setup logging functionality for systems and networks, in accordance with GC [Event Logging Guidance](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/online-security-privacy/event-logging-guidance.html).
- Limit access to logs to those who need to review them.
- Implementing automatic alerting in order for anomalies in activity patterns to be flagged and reviewed, as well as potential vulnerabilities and events that need risk mitigation action to be taken.
- Continuously monitor directory services (and other primary user stores) for indicators of compromise or active attack.
