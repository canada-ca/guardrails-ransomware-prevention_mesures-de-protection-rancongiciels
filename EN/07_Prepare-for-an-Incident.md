# Prepare for an Incident

([Back](/README.md#guidelines))

## Objective

Establish an incident management plan, with clearly defined actions, roles and responsibilities, to ensure that cyber
security incidents are contained, eradicated and recovered from in a timely manner.

## Description

- Develop a departmental cyber security event management plan (CSEMP) with clear roles and responsibilities, in alignment with the [Government of Canada Cyber Security Event Management Plan](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/online-security-privacy/security-identity-management/government-canada-cyber-security-event-management-plan.html#toc5).
- Test the departmental CSEMP at regular intervals:
  - It is strongly advised  to test the CSEMP annually.
