# Prepare for an Incident

## Objective

Establish an incident management plan, with clearly defined actions, roles and responsibilities, to ensure that cyber
security incidents are contained, eradicated and recovered from in a timely manner.

## Description

- Develop a departmental cyber security event management plan with clear roles and responsibilities, in alignment with the [Government of Canada Cyber Security Event Management Plan](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/online-security-privacy/security-identity-management/government-canada-cyber-security-event-management-plan.html#toc5).
- Maintain an up-to-date list of internal and external contacts for ransomware attacks, including law enforcement.
- As ransomware is considered a criminal offence, if you are a victim of ransomware, in addition to reporting to relevant internal and external bodies, report it to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) by contacting NC3Cyber-CyberGNC3@rcmp-grc.gc.ca and [CCCS](https://cyber.gc.ca/en/incident-management) at cyberincident@cyber.gc.ca.
