# Regularly Backup Important Data and Systems

## Objective

Perform offline back-ups of systems that contain essential business information and ensure that recovery mechanisms effectively and efficiently restore these systems from back-ups.

## Description

- Carefully plan, implement, and test a data backup and restoration strategy for important files/data and systems that can be restored in the event of an incident.
- Securely store back-ups in an encrypted state and restrict access to them to only those who must access them for testing or restoration activities.
- Make multiple copies of files using different backup solutions and storage locations (e.g., in a different data center or cloud tenancy).
- Ensure that backups are only connected to known clean devices before starting recovery
- Scan backups for malware before restoring files in the case that ransomware may have been replicated to backups before being discovered.
