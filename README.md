# Guardrails for Ransomware Prevention and Mitigation

This project will host the minimum guardrails as part of the GC Cloud Operationalization Framework. The users of this project will be Government of Canada employees deploying cloud-based workloads.

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to

- support GC organizations in understanding existing TBS security policy requirements in the context of ransomware
  prevention and mitigation
- provide a baseline set of controls to protect GC information, information technology (IT) assets and infrastructure against
  ransomware attacks

## Context

Ransomware is a growing cyber threat which compromises the safety of our citizens, the security of the online environment, and the
prosperity of our economies. It can pose a significant threat to Governments, critical infrastructure and essential services on which
all our citizens depend. The Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (CCCS) defines ransomware as a type of malware that denies a user’s
access to a system or data until a sum of money is paid<sup>1</sup> Ransomware can have severe impacts including core business downtime,
permanent data loss, intellectual property theft, privacy breaches, reputational damage and expensive recovery costs.

## Guidelines

The following section outlines a baseline set of controls to protect the GC information, information technology (IT) assets and
infrastructure against ransomware attacks and to recover from ransomware.
